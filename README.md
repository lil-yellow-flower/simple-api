# simple-api
A simple api

A simple API that can be used to organize boarding cards.

Imagine that you are a busy traveller, flying across the world. All of a sudden someone bumps into you and you drop all of your carefully organized boarding cards on the floor :O

The solution:
Simply POST them to the controller and watch as they magically get sent back to you in the correct order!

Sample data:

[
  "GOT-ARN",
  "HEL-GOT",
  "CPH-HEL",
  "ARN-ARL",
  "ARL-WSH",
  "WSH-TKY",
  "TKY-PRS",
  "PRS-HMB"
]

Ps. POST as JSON and API will be happy! (ง ͡ʘ ͜ʖ ͡ʘ)ง
